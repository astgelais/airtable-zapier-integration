# airtable-zapier-integration
This simple php script is designed to grab all records out of an Airtable database table and then post them to a Zapier webhook. This was created as Airtable's API did not yet have the functionality to send Zapier the information we needed. Feel free to modify this script for your needs.

This is script calls the Airtable API via CURL to grab all the information and then posts that information to a Zapier webhook via CURL.
